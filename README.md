# iOS 11 GUI for Framer

An iOS 11 graphical user interface element library assembled for Framer by [@brentcas][1].

To open the Framer files, you need to have [Framer][2] installed on your macOS device. This collection of files is organized into folders like so:

> Style
> - Colors.framer
> - Fonts.framer

> Elements
> - System.framer
> - Bars.framer
> - Controls.framer
> - Views.framer
> - Keyboards.framer

Each Framer file has a collection of designed elements, and contains no prototype code. These elements are for the purposes of copying and pasting into your own prototypes, or being used as a design reference.

I can be contacted on Twitter [@brentcas][3] where I accept messages from anyone.
